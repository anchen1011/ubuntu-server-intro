# ubuntu-server-intro

introduction to basic function and usage of ubuntu server (with a simple example).

## [for windows-only user] git-bash
If you have only windows machine, you will have lots of troubles with server but you can still get most of functionality with e.g. git-bash. Install git-bash following https://git-for-windows.github.io and open your git-bash when I say **terminal** in all following sections.

## connect
open your terminal, and type in command `ssh [username]@[server.address]`

e.g. `ssh baian@ec2-**-**-***-***.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com`

Type in your password when it prompts out.

When you see a banner at the top of your terminal and a new interface, you are successfully connected.

## never do these
Once you are connected, please be sure that you should never do these unless you fully understand what you are doing.
